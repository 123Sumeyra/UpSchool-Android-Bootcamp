## :bulb:ViewModelFactory

### :pushpin:Why a viewmodel factory is needed in Android? 
if you don't need an argument in the constructor, you can use just **ViewModelProviders.of()**. Because this method creates default **ViewModelProvider.Factory**.

Ä°f we set some parametres in constructor and initialize it later.  We won't see error in build but we will face error in Run Time.  We can handle this problem with ViewModelFactory.
